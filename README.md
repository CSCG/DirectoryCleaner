    Why?
  </h2>

The main focus of this application is to make it as easy as possible to clean up directories that just have a bunch of loose files laying around that may not be that important. I DO NOT recommend using this on a software project directory for obvious reasons. It is fully customizable and any of the default names can be changed if for some reason you don't like the default folder names or perhaps even the extremely inventive name DirectoryCleaner.

#### Commands

```
positional arguments:
  path                  The path to the directory that you want to cleanup not
                        actually the word path. Ex. DirectoryCleaner
                        /Users/Username/desktop

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --folder_cleanup, -fc
                        Set this flag if you want folders to also be included
                        in the clean up.
  --main_folder_name, -mfn
                        Set this flag and specify the name you would like the
                        main folder to be called. The date will always be
                        apart of the name, only DirectoryCleaner will be
                        changed.
  --revert_settings, -rs
                        Revert the settings file to its default state when the
                        program was downloaded. Will use the default settings
                        to run the program as well.
  --change_folder_names, -cfn
                        Set this flag if you want to rename one of the default
                        folder names Directory Cleaner uses for that type of
                        file.
